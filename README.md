### What it is?!

Simple repostory which can be cloned to bootstrap a Python project. Provides a
simple list of TODO items for getting your project up as fast as possible,
which can be discovered by searching the repository for the word TODO after
downloading or forking it.

For instance, a step may look like this in the code:

    TODO: Replace README.md with a file that explains your project.

Yes, this is a real one. You should definitely do it :)


### Examples of setting up

In most Unix operating systems, you can find TODO items with grep:

    $ grep -R TODO .

In Vim, you could find and show a list with:


    :vimgrep TODO **
    :copen

In most GUI-based text editors, you can use CTRL+SHIFT+F and search files for
TODO.
